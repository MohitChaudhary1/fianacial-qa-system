# Financial Q&A System - RAG 

A focused RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with basic agent capabilities that answers both simple and comparative financial questions about Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA using their recent 10-K filings.

## 🎯 Overview

This system demonstrates:
- **Vector-based RAG implementation** using TF-IDF embeddings
- **Agent orchestration** for query decomposition and multi-step reasoning
- **Multi-step retrieval and synthesis** for complex financial queries
- **Clean engineering practices** with modular design

## 📊 Data Scope

- **Companies**: Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA)
- **Documents**: Annual 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, 2024
- **Total Files**: 9 documents (3 companies × 3 years)
- **Source**: SEC EDGAR database (mock data for demonstration)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd financial-qa-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Set up API key for full LLM capabilities
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env
```

### 2. Run the System

```bash
# Set up the system (creates vector database with mock data)
python main.py setup

# Ask a single question
python main.py query "What was NVIDIA's revenue in 2024?"

# Interactive mode
python main.py query -i

# Run demo with test queries
python main.py demo

# Test all query types
python main.py test
```

## 🎯 Supported Query Types

### 1. Basic Metrics
```
"What was Microsoft's total revenue in 2023?"
→ Microsoft reported total revenue of $211,915 million in fiscal year 2023.
```

### 2. YoY Comparison
```
"How did NVIDIA's data center revenue grow from 2022 to 2023?"
→ NVIDIA's data center revenue grew from $15,000 million to $47,500 million, 
  representing a 216.7% increase.
```

### 3. Cross-Company Analysis
```
"Which company had the highest operating margin in 2023?"
→ NVIDIA had the highest operating margin at 55.0% in 2023.
```

### 4. Segment Analysis
```
"What percentage of Google's revenue came from cloud in 2023?"
→ Google's cloud revenue represented 10.8% of total revenue in 2023.
```

### 5. Complex Multi-step
```
"Compare the R&D spending as a percentage of revenue across all three companies in 2023"
→ R&D spending as percentage of revenue in 2023: 
  Google: 12.9% ($39,508M out of $307,394M); 
  Microsoft: 12.8% ($27,211M out of $211,915M); 
  NVIDIA: 17.0% ($10,373M out of $60,922M)
```

## 📊 Output Format

The system returns JSON responses with the following structure:

```json
{
  "query": "Which company had the highest operating margin in 2023?",
  "answer": "NVIDIA had the highest operating margin at 55.0% in 2023.",
  "reasoning": "Analyzed financial data from 3 companies across 1 years using 5 relevant document sections.",
  "sub_queries": [
    "Google operating margin 2023",
    "Microsoft operating margin 2023",
    "NVIDIA operating margin 2023"
  ],
  "sources": [
    {
      "company": "NVDA",
      "year": 2023,
      "excerpt": "NVIDIA's revenue more than doubled to $60.9 billion in 2023...",
      "section_type": "md_a"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Chunking Strategy
- **Size**: 800 characters (~600-800 tokens)
- **Overlap**: 100 characters (~75-100 tokens)
- **Separators**: `["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]` for semantic boundaries
- **Focus**: Key financial sections with metadata

### Embedding Model
- **Primary**: HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Fallback**: Simple TF-IDF embeddings (for dependency-free operation)
- **Normalization**: Enabled for better similarity search

### Agent Approach
- **Query Classification**: Simple, Comparative, Growth Analysis, Calculation
- **Decomposition**: Break complex queries into targeted sub-queries
- **Synthesis**: Combine results using rule-based logic + LLM reasoning

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ImportError with transformers/sentence-transformers**
   ```bash
   # System works without these dependencies using TF-IDF fallback
   # For full functionality, install:
   pip install sentence-transformers==2.7.0
   ```

2. **No GROQ_API_KEY found**
   - System works in demo mode without API key
   - Get free key from https://console.groq.com/
   - Create `.env` file with: `GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here`

3. **Module not found errors**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
